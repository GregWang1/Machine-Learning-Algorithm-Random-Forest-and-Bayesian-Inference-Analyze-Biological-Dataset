# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-Random-Forest-and-Bayesian-Inference-Analyze-Biological-Dataset

This study use machine learning algorithm Random Forest and Bayesian inference analyze a diabetic dataset.

The results demonstrate that age, BMI, DPF and pregnancies positively correlate with diabetic outcome.

Importantly, pregnancies  have no contribution to glucose level, although contributing to diabetic outcome.

Therefore, a new hypothesis should be formulated regarding pregnancies affecting diabetic outcome, and Bayesian inference can monitor and update the data continoulsy.

Conclusion, the machie learning algorith is an excellent tool to pickup important targets and Bayesian inference is very helpful to confirm targets and provide import supposting points for a new hypothesis
